[{"content":" Modernisation and responsive, accessible, green re-design of a website following UX audit and user testing Case study #Issues and recommendations # Original design My re-design This website wasn\u0026rsquo;t compatible with smaller screens. The colors were lacking in contrast (2.47:1). The EU directive on web accessibility requires a score of 4.5:1 or better.\nI created an accessible visual identity (rapport 15.13:1, 6.19:1) and a responsive design, making the site usable on screens under a width of 800 pixels.\nOriginal information architecture The site\u0026rsquo;s information architecture made navigation complex. There was repetition of some info. The most attractive and up to date content was hidden deep in the site\u0026rsquo;s navigation.\nMy modified architecture I cut down a lot of pages to make information easier to find. I merged and renamed some pages to make them easier to understand.\nGreen IT and A11y #I decided to go for a mobile-first design, to make it lighter and easier on less resource-hungry. I also reduced media resolution and saturation, and created a design system with only three different colors.\nUser testing # How testers felt along the user journey After creating an interactive prototype for my design, I tested it with 5 users who would be part of the target for the non-profit.\nA few questions from the SUS The users navigated through the prototype to complete to tasks (register for training and applying for a job). They then completed the SUS, a standardized post-usability test questionnaire.\nThe prototype got an average score of 80%. This shows that the user interface est not only usable and functional, but also simple to understand, and a pleasure to navigate through.\nQuelques citations verbatim des testeuses :\nI am glad that I have a phonecall as an option.\nIt's actually nice [...], it's pleasant to use.\nPrototype # Tools I worked with # Paper and pencils Capian UXTweak Figma Miro [redacted] Analytics ","date":null,"permalink":"/home/en/work/asbl/","section":"Work","summary":"Responsive, green and accessible re-design following UX research","title":"Design of a non-profit's website"},{"content":" Accessible modern mobile design for Villo bicycle renting Screens # Homepage Prototype # Télécharger le script Tools I worked with # Figma Freepik ","date":null,"permalink":"/home/en/work/villo/","section":"Work","summary":"Accessible modern mobile design for Villo bicycle renting","title":"Mobile version of the Villo! website"},{"content":" Accessible, green design for an online grocery app Screens # Prototype # Télécharger le script Tools I worked with # Figma Freepik A certain icon site ","date":null,"permalink":"/home/en/work/food/","section":"Work","summary":"What it says on the tin","title":"Grocery shopping app design"},{"content":" Just a spoonful of sugar\u0026hellip; Storytime #This started as a practical exercise on using CSS grids.
