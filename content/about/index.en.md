My name is Hawa. I work as an **UX/UI designer**. I am located in Belgium at the moment.

![Autumn leaves](leaves.jpg) 

I've brought computers back to life and turned stuff off an on again about ten thousand times. This taught me how to find or create solutions **on my own or as part of a team**, and to use assertive communication and agile management to achieve my clients' goals.

Somehow, I ended up realising that the ultimate solution to every problem ever was designing **super cool and accessible** user interfaces. 
Now I mostly listen to end users, research their needs, and **keep the human on the other end of the screen** in mind no matter what I'm working on.


### I love :
- Overnight oats
- The *Festival della canzone italiana*
- [Visible keyboard focus](https://www.elevenways.be/fr/articles/tout-ce-que-vous-devez-savoir-sur-accessibilite-obligatoire-des-applications-gouvernementales)
